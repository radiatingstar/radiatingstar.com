## Tooling

### Netlify

Site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It uses the [Gatsby Cache](https://github.com/jlengstorf/netlify-plugin-gatsby-cache#readme)
plugin and [Lighthouse](https://github.com/netlify-labs/netlify-plugin-lighthouse#readme) plugin.

Project is available here: https://app.netlify.com/sites/radiatingstarcom/overview

### Forestry.io

I have no idea why I installed this tool long time ago. Will have to research sometime in the future. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Stuff to remember

### Redirects

Initially, the blog was served from the root domain. Old posts had to be redirected to the new `/blog` path, hence
the hell lot of redirects in the `netlify.toml` file.

### TypeScript definitions codegen

The app's using [`gatsby-plugin-graphql-codegen`](https://github.com/d4rekanguok/gatsby-typescript/blob/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-graphql-codegen/readme.md).
The types' generation takes too much time during development, so it's only available when running the app with the `CODEGEN` env
set to `true`.

### Pages

The pages components in the pages' directory are meant to query the required data and pass
it to the UI component. That's why they're only re-exporting those components. Don't put anything else in there.
